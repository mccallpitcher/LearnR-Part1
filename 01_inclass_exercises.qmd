Welcome to your first Quarto document! This is where you will try out all of the hands-on exercises in the workshop.

## 05. How do I write and run code in a coding notebook?

Write and run code that finds the square root of 60

Hint: the square root function in R is `sqrt()`

```{r}

```

## 06. What is an object and how do I create one?

Create an object called `my_age` that stores your age, then call the object so it prints to the Console.

```{r}

```

## 08. **How do I import data?**

Load the Taylor Swift data using `read_csv()`. You can name your data frame object `tswift`

```{r}

```

## 09. **How can I get to know my variables?**

Using `summary()`, determine whether the mean or median of `danceability` is greater.

```{r}

```

## 10. **What are some ways I can transform my data?**

### 10.1 Subset rows with `filter()`

Filter `tswift` to only contain songs that are *NOT* on the "Lover" album

```{r}

```

### 10.2 Subset columns with `select()`

Limit the columns in `tswift` to only include `name` and `speechiness`

```{r}

```

### 10.3 Sort rows with `arrange()`

Find the 3 most popular Taylor Swift songs (according to Spotify)

*Hint:* Browse the environment pane for the variable that measures this (it's near the bottom)

```{r}

```

### 10.4 Create new variables with `mutate()`

Create a new variable in `tswift` that multiplies `danceability` by 100 (you pick the name of the new variable), then limit your columns to `name`, `danceability`, and your new variable.

Note: The symbol for multiplication in R is `*`

```{r}

```
